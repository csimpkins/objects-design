Object-Oriented Design and Developement (OOD)
=============================================

Course materials for my CS 2340 Objects and Design course at Georgia Tech.

- the course's goal of teaching software engineering practices (like team development) in preparation for senior capstone, and
- a more general idea of design than object-oriented design.  Although OOA/OOD still makes up the bulk of the course, we discuss general design priciples and UI design as well.
